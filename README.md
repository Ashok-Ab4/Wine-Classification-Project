# Wine-Classification-Project

### Simple text classification project
### tools used: Dask, MLFlow, Sklearn, Spacy, Lime 

#### Data first tokenized with spacy. Then used to train different baseline classification models. Best performer then subjected to hyperparameter tuning. 

#### Once model was finalized, visualizations were made to analyse the coefficients the model used to make the classifications as well as confusion matrices to see how the model performed.

#### A couple of methods were tested to improve performance - changing the labelling scheme and restricting the test set values using decision function calculations.
